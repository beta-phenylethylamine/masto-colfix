**If you are not a mastodon.social user, you must edit this style once you've installed it to apply on your instance's domain** (I wish I could've made that a variable too, but stylus was having none of it)

A quick fix to mastodon's ugly columns that makes them fit to screen. Lets you set the width of the drawer (where you post from) and the min-width (width at which they no longer fit to screen) for columns.

(I have a fairly small screen, so cut me some slack here)

Two columns:

Three columns:

Overflow (when making the columns fit the screen would cause you to go below the Min Width set):
